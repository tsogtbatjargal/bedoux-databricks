## Current state

Chapters 00–03 are integrated into `main`, and so are chapter 04's first
two increments; the third is an open PR. **196 tests pass on `main`, 219
on `feat/04-report-citations`.** Posts for chapters 00–03 are drafted,
none published, no tags.

- **Chapter 02** is demonstrated live — see
  [chapter-02-evidence.md](chapter-02-evidence.md).
- **Chapter 03 is acceptance-complete at code level, not demonstrated live
  against a model** (the user's decision). Its last criterion, "a failed
  check prevents the external call," is met by chapter 04's model-call
  path: `test_evaluate_evidence_gate_verdict_alone_stops_the_call` forces
  the gate to refuse clean evidence and asserts zero provider calls. Since
  PR #20, `send_payload` also refuses anything but a `CheckedPayload`, so
  the gate can't be skipped by calling it directly. The provider is a test
  fake; no evidence has ever left the process. See
  [chapters/03-protect-evidence.md](chapters/03-protect-evidence.md#roadmap-acceptance-mapping).
- **Chapter 03's append-only evidence log** is deployed and confirmed live
  across four `dev` runs plus a negative `UPDATE`/`DELETE` test. One
  predicted limitation confirmed and not fixed: a task retry writes a
  duplicate row. See [chapter-03-evidence.md](chapter-03-evidence.md) and
  [known-gaps.md](known-gaps.md#durable-incident-evidence-is-manual).
- **Chapter 04, first increment** (PR #18, merge `b347a1c`, eighth CI
  deployment): `src/bedoux/model_call.py`, the guarded model-call path.
- **Chapter 04, second increment** (PR #20, merge `27e20c1`, ninth CI
  deployment: `Files: 72 uploaded, 0 deleted`, `Resources: 0 created, 0
  changed, 0 deleted, 8 unchanged`):
  - `src/bedoux/incidents.py`: a local append-only JSON Lines incident log.
    `investigate()` saves an incident (the checked payload, or no evidence
    if the gate blocked) and fsyncs it before calling the provider, then
    records the outcome. A process that dies mid-call leaves the incident
    pending.
  - `model_call.CheckedPayload`: only `prepare_payload` can create one, and
    `send_payload` raises `TypeError` on anything else before touching the
    provider.
  - Unproven: durability through a machine crash (only process death is
    tested), concurrent writers, retry deduplication, anything live.
  - Only a test fake exists as a provider, and nothing in
    `bedoux_analytics_job` calls either module. See
    [chapters/04-investigate-recover.md](chapters/04-investigate-recover.md).
- **Chapter 04, third increment: open PR from `feat/04-report-citations`,
  not merged** (merging deploys). A report needs a non-empty `citations`
  list of paths like `rows[0].stage`, each resolving to non-redacted
  evidence in the payload the provider was sent; otherwise it's `pending`
  (`no_citations`, `unresolved_citation`, `redacted_citation`).
  `screen_report` refuses a report echoing the canary or a secret
  (`report_leak`), in `call_model` and before storage. A checked report is
  now stored in the incident log. 23 new tests. Citation checks prove a
  citation *exists* in what was sent, not that it supports the claim.

**Left for the user, deliberately:** the diagrams. `architecture-context.svg`'s
`<desc>` still says "no such call site exists yet in this project" — out of
date since chapter 04's first increment. The user maintains the diagrams by
hand.

[known-gaps.md](known-gaps.md) is current, including the entry recording
that chapter 04's runtime model provider is a deliberate scope decision,
covered in the post/video instead of built.
[claude-implementation.md](claude-implementation.md) is a dated, expiring
brief — delete or archive it when the next chapter-04 increment starts
(see [README.md](README.md)'s "Docs lifecycle").

## Branches and PRs

Remote branches: `main`; the five retained chapter branches
(`series/00-introduction`, `series/01-know-your-platform`,
`series/02-quality-gate`, `series/03-protect-evidence`,
`series/04-investigate-recover`); and the working branch
`feat/04-report-citations` (the open PR). `feat/04-incident-log` was
deleted after confirming it was merged into `origin/main`. See
[branch-workflow.md](branch-workflow.md).

Local branches: `main`, `series/04-investigate-recover`, and
`feat/04-report-citations`.

**One open PR:** chapter 04's third increment, from
`feat/04-report-citations`. Not merged — merging deploys.

## Exact next useful task

Review the report-citations PR, then decide whether to merge it (a
deployment). After that, chapter 04's next step, which needs its own
authorization: a bounded read-only tool set with recovery denied by code.
The runtime model provider stays deliberately unbuilt.
